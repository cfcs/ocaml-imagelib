The imagelib library
====================

The imagelib library implements image formats such as PNG and PPM  in
OCaml, relying on only one external dependency: `decompress`.

Supported image formats:
 - PNG (full implementation of RFC 2083),
 - PPM, PGM, PBM, ... (fully supported),
 - BMP (mostly supported),
 - JPG (only image size natively, conversion to PNG otherwise),
 - GIF (only image size natively, conversion to PNG otherwise),
   - There is an experimental native implementation available in the pure `ImageLib` module.
 - XCF (only image size natively, conversion to PNG otherwise),
 - Other formats rely on convert (imagemagick).

As imagelib only requires `decompress`, it is suitable for compilation to
javascript using `js_of_ocaml` (only for operations not requiring the
convert binary).

Dependencies
------------
List of dependencies:
 - OCaml (at least 4.03.0)
 - dune (at least 1.2.0)
 - decompress (version 0.8.1)
 - GNU Make (build)

Additional packages:
 - ImageMagick (convert) for handling some formats.
 - Crowbar, Alcotest (for the test suite)

Installation
------------

Imagelib is available on `opam` (run `opam install imagelib`). It can also
be installed from source as follows.

```bash
make
make install
```

Fuzzing
-------

This section is primarily of use for developers of the library.

The `aflrunner.exe` target can be used to fuzz test the image parsers with [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl).
- It will only be built if the `afl-persistent` OPAM package is installed.
- The parser is selected using the filename extension.

Here is an example, requiring at least one valid BMP file in a folder called `sample-bmps/`:
```shell
imagelib $ opam install -y afl-persistent
imagelib $ dune build
imagelib $ afl-fuzz \
  -i sample-bmps/ \
  -o bmp-results/ \
  -f /dev/shm/my.bmp -- ./_build/default/tests/aflrunner.exe x /dev/shm/my.bmp
```

Once one or more crashes have been identified, you can inspect them like this:
```shell
imagelib/bmpfuzz/crashes $ export OCAMLRUNPARAM=b
imagelib/bmpfuzz/crashes $ for x in id\:*
    do echo ":: $x"
    cp "$x" x.bmp
    ../../_build/default/tests/aflrunner.exe x x.bmp
    echo "// $x"
  done
